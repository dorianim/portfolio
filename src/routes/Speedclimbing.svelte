		<p class="">
			When I was four years old, my Dad took me to the climbing gym for the first time. I was
			immediately fascinated by the sport and started climbing regularly. At the age of 5, I joined
			the <a href="https://climbingteam.de">Climbingteam Stuttgart</a>
			and started to compete in kids-cups, which was a combination of lead, bouldering and classic speed.
			<br />
			As I grew older, I started to compete at state and later at national level, at the time, speed
			was not really a thing yet, so I competed in lead and bouldering.
			<br />
			When I was about 15 years old, I touched the normspeed wall for the first time. It was love at
			first sight. I started to improove rapidly and won a bronze medal on my first national speed youth
			cup in 2017.
			<br />
			After that, I still competed in lead and bouldering, but speed was slowly starting to become my
			main focus. In 2020 I ultimately decided to compeletely focus on speed. In 2021, I was able to
			qualify for my first international speed competition, the European Youth Cup in Bochum, where I
			placed 4th.
			<br />
			Since then, there have been lots of ups and downs, but overall I am making good progress and was
			able to accomplish my big dream of competing in a worldcup in 2023.
